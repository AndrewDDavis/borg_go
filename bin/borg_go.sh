  borg_go
  -------
  This script runs BorgBackup with the typical configuration and command options to
  create, prune, and check backups.

  Usage: borg_go [options] <command1 command2 ...>

  Commands:
    create  -> create a new backup archive in the default repository
    prune   -> remove old archives according to rules
    check   -> check integrity of repo and latest archive
    compact -> save space in repo; runs automatically after prune

  Options:
    -n | --dry-run -> run create and/or prune without changing the repo, to see what
                      would be backed up or removed. check and compact are not affected
                      by the dry-run option, but compact will not run automatically
                      after prune on a dry-run.

  For config and setup, see readme.

# Check for root
# - borg create requires root to read all files
# - generally a good idea to run as root when making changes to the repo otherwise
#   (i.e. anything beyond borg list or borg info), to prevent permissions issues in
#   the security and cache dirs.
# - in the docs, it is strongly recommended to always access the repository using
#   the same user account, to avoid permissions issues in your borg repository or
#   borg cache. For remote repos, it's straightforward to always use `ssh user@host`.
#   For local repositories, using `user@localhost:/path/to/repo` for BORG_REPO
#   ensures the same user always accesses the repo.

# Environment variables
# - set in user ~/.bashrc or launchd plist: BORG_REPO, BORG_CONFIG_DIR, BORG_LOGGING_CONF

    # - The '{hostname}-' prefix limits the prune operation to the archives associated
    #   with the present machine.
    # - N.B. the keep rules do not operate exactly as you may expect, because intervals
    #   in which there are no backups are not counted. E.g., if you only did 7 backups
    #   in the last year, and they were all on different days, then --keep-daily 7 would
    #   keep all those backups for the last year, not just the ones in the past week.
    #   Or, e.g. if you only backup daily, and use --keep-hourly 24, the last 24 days of
    #   backups will be kept. The keep-within rules are more like this, but not
    #   exactly...
    # - From the docs:
    #     + The --keep-within option takes an argument of the form “<int><char>”, where
    #       char is “H”, “d”, “w”, “m”, “y”. For example, --keep-within 2d means to keep
    #       all archives that were created within the past 48 hours.
    #     + The archives kept with this option do not count towards the totals specified
    #       by any other options.
    #     + E.g., --keep-daily 7 means to keep the latest backup on each day, up to 7
    #       most recent days with backups (days without backups do not count).
    # - If any rule is not fully satisfied, the earliest backup is retained.
    # - Weeks go from Monday to Sunday, so weekly backups may keep e.g. a Tuesday and a
    #   Sunday archive if that's all it has to choose from.
    # - See the docs for examples, but the finer details probably don't matter to us:
    #   https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage/prune.html
    # - The following options should keep every archive within the last 14 days, and
    #   weekly archives for 2 weeks that have a backup before that, then similarly for 6
    #   monthly archives, and 3 yearly archives.
